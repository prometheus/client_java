    # excluding simpleclient_archive from the update is not possible, only includes are supported
    # when we use includes, we run into https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/10415 -
    # even if we limit to 1 PR at a time
    # therefore we just ignore the simpleclient_archive update for now
    # if this becomes a problem, we can move to renovate
