The Prometheus Java client library 1.0.0 is a complete rewrite of the underlying data model, and is
not backward
compatible with releases 0.16.0 and older for a variety of reasons:

- The old data model was based on [OpenMetrics](https://openmetrics.io). Native histograms don't fit
  with the
  OpenMetrics model because they don't follow the "every sample has exactly one double value"
  paradigm. It was a lot
  cleaner to implement a dedicated `prometheus-metrics-model` than trying to fit native histograms
  into the existing
  OpenMetrics-based model.
- Version 0.16.0 and older has multiple Maven modules sharing the same Java package name. This is
  not supported by the
  Java module system. To support users of Java modules, we renamed all packages and made sure no
  package is reused
  across multiple Maven modules.

## Migration using the Simpleclient Bridge

Good news: Users of version 0.16.0 and older do not need to refactor all their instrumentation code
to get started with
1.0.0.

We provide a migration module for bridging the old simpleclient `CollectorRegistry` to the new
`PrometheusRegistry`.

To use the bridge, add the following dependency:

{{< tabs "uniqueid" >}}
{{< tab "Gradle" >}}

```groovy
implementation 'io.prometheus:prometheus-metrics-simpleclient-bridge:1.0.0'
```

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Maven" >}}

```xml

<dependency>
  <groupId>io.prometheus</groupId>
  <artifactId>prometheus-metrics-simpleclient-bridge</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

Then add the following to your code:

```java
SimpleclientCollector.builder().register();
```

This will make all metrics registered with simpleclient's `CollectorRegistry.defaultRegistry`
available in the new
`PrometheusRegistry.defaultRegistry`.

If you are using custom registries, you can specify them like this:

```java
CollectorRegistry simpleclientRegistry = ...;
PrometheusRegistry prometheusRegistry = ...;

SimpleclientCollector.builder()
  .collectorRegistry(simpleclientRegistry)
  .register(prometheusRegistry);
```

## Refactoring the Instrumentation Code

If you decide to get rid of the old 0.16.0 dependencies and use 1.0.0 only, you need to refactor
your code:

Dependencies:

- `simpleclient` -> `prometheus-metrics-core`
- `simpleclient_hotspot` -> `prometheus-metrics-instrumentation-jvm`
- `simpleclient_httpserver` -> `prometheus-metrics-exporter-httpserver`
- `simpleclient_servlet_jakarta` -> `prometheus-metrics-exporter-servlet-jakarta`

As long as you are using high-level metric API like `Counter`, `Gauge`, `Histogram`, and `Summary`
converting code to
the new API is relatively straightforward. You will need to adapt the package name and apply some
minor changes like
using `builder()` instead of `build()` or using `labelValues()` instead of `labels()`.

Example of the old 0.16.0 API:

```java
import io.prometheus.client.Counter;

Counter counter = Counter.build()
  .name("test")
  .help("test counter")
  .labelNames("path")
  .register();

counter.labels("/hello-world").inc();
```

Example of the new 1.0.0 API:

```java
import io.prometheus.metrics.core.metrics.Counter;

Counter counter = Counter.builder()
  .name("test")
  .help("test counter")
  .labelNames("path")
  .register();

counter.labelValues("/hello-world").inc();
```

Reasons why we changed the API: Changing the package names was a necessity because the previous
package names were
incompatible with the Java module system. However, renaming packages requires changing code anyway,
so we decided to
clean up some things. For example, the name `builder()` for a builder method is very common in the
Java ecosystem, it's
used in Spring, Lombok, and so on. So naming the method `builder()` makes the Prometheus library
more aligned with the
broader Java ecosystem.

If you are using the low level `Collector` API directly, you should have a look at the new callback
metric types,
see [/getting-started/callbacks/]({{< relref "../getting-started/callbacks.md" >}}). Chances are
good that the new callback metrics have
an easier way to achieve what you need than the old 0.16.0 code.

## JVM Metrics

Version 0.16.0 provided the `simpleclient_hotspot` module for exposing built-in JVM metrics:

```java
DefaultExports.initialize();
```

With version 1.0.0 these metrics moved to the `prometheus-metrics-instrumentation-jvm` module and
are initialized as follows:

```java
JvmMetrics.builder().register();
```

A full list of the available JVM metrics can be found
on [/instrumentation/jvm]({{< relref "../instrumentation/jvm.md" >}}).

Most JVM metric names remained the same, except for a few cases where the old 0.16.0 metric names
were not compliant with the [OpenMetrics](https://openmetrics.io) specification. OpenMetrics
requires the unit to be a suffix, so we renamed metrics where the unit was in the middle of the
metric name and moved the unit to the end of the metric name. The following metric names changed:

- `jvm_memory_bytes_committed` -> `jvm_memory_committed_bytes`
- `jvm_memory_bytes_init` -> `jvm_memory_init_bytes`
- `jvm_memory_bytes_max` -> `jvm_memory_max_bytes`
- `jvm_memory_pool_bytes_committed` -> `jvm_memory_pool_committed_bytes`
- `jvm_memory_pool_bytes_init` -> `jvm_memory_pool_init_bytes`
- `jvm_memory_pool_bytes_max` -> `jvm_memory_pool_max_bytes`
- `jvm_memory_pool_bytes_used` -> `jvm_memory_pool_used_bytes`
- `jvm_memory_pool_collection_bytes_committed` -> `jvm_memory_pool_collection_committed_bytes`
- `jvm_memory_pool_collection_bytes_init` -> `jvm_memory_pool_collection_init_bytes`
- `jvm_memory_pool_collection_bytes_max` -> `jvm_memory_pool_collection_max_bytes`
- `jvm_memory_pool_collection_bytes_used` -> `jvm_memory_pool_collection_used_bytes`
- `jvm_info` -> `jvm_runtime_info`
